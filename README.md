We have a two state quantum system time evolving with rotating field hamiltonian. I used Runge-Kutta Method to solve schrodinger equation for such system, then I ploted the quantum state on a Bloch sphere using OpenGL.

I also mean to calculate geometric phase(Berry's phase) with this setup and show it on the sphere.
